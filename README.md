## 📋 Overview
High-performance Python script designed to scrape, structure, and export product data from e-commerce platforms. This tool automates the process of market research by extracting pricing, availability, and product details into clean CSV formats ready for analysis.

## ⚙️ Key Features
* **Automated Pagination:** Intelligently iterates through all available catalogue pages until the end.
* **Anti-Bot Detection:** Implements strategic delays (`time.sleep`) to mimic human behavior and avoid IP bans.
* **Data Cleaning:** Sanitizes currency symbols (e.g., converting 'Â£' to '£') and text encoding on the fly.
* **Export Ready:** Generates standardized `.csv` files compatible with Excel, Power BI, and SQL.
